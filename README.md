# Console Application - Expertise Groups Management System

## Description
This is a console-based application developed in C++ for managing a graph structure. The application allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize a graph that represents relationships between different entities. It supports operations such as adding and removing vertices (nodes) and edges (connections), displaying the graph structure, and implementing additional functionalities based on specific use cases.

## Features
- **Graph Creation**: Initialize and manage a graph structure with vertices and edges.
- **Vertex Operations**:
  - Add new vertices representing groups or entities.
  - Find and display details of specific vertices.
  - Remove vertices along with their associated edges.
- **Edge Operations**:
  - Add edges between existing vertices to represent connections or relationships.
  - Remove specific edges from the graph.
- **Visualization**:
  - Display all vertices and their connections.
  - List members or entities associated with specific vertices.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**:
  - Interactive and user-friendly menu for performing various graph-related operations.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Supports additional functionalities such as finding frequently traversed nodes, determining alternative routes, or other use-case-specific procedures.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for developing the application.
- **Code::Blocks**: a free, open-source, cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for programming in C/C++, Fortran, and other languages
